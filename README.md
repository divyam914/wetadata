Yo yo yo here's the readme y'all
You've all got your own branches, where you'll make your own changes there. Push and do whatever you'd like with your branch. It's your personal development branch! Once things are tested really well and we've discussed some of the changes and looked at the code, you can merge with the master branch, which will be like our production branch. Be careful with the master branch b/e once we deploy that's what people are gonna see.

Let's talk later about how to use git and also what style we wanna agree upon for eslinting.
